# Rust Finance Calculator

This is a simple investment calculator that produces the total investment return based off of a few factors. This calculator was built in Rust and turned into a python module using py03 so you 
can use python code for simplicity and then use the rust calculator in your program. 


## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. First I had to install py03 and setup a virtual environment
2. Then I wrote the Rust code and imported it into my python code and thats pretty much it


Instructions for using the software:

1. It is very simple you just run the code and the calculator will prompt you with investment questions.


## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Softwares used were vsCode, py03, and rust. All the latest versions


## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Youtube]([Link](https://www.youtube.com/))
* [W3Schools]([[Link](https://www.youtube.com/)](https://www.w3schools.com/))
* Claude AI

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* I plan to expand this to do more complicated computations that take much more computing time so that we can really enhance the use of Rust over Python
* Next I'd like to implement more Rust modules to make Python development faster similar to what polars did compared to pandas.
